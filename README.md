# Crop-identification-using-real-time-satellite-imagery-on-the-Farm-level

We started off with analyzing the data set. We performed EDA on the merged file(created using train labels and and train dataset file). The resultant file was then analysed for any missing values, null values or duplicated values and were removed eventually. The resultant was saved as a file. We have analysed the data using basic functinos and attributes like head, info, describe, shape. We have pre-processed the features file that consists of ndvi values. We have replaced all the missing values(denoted as -999) with nan and then we dropped the null values.Train file is obtained by merging the label file and the feature file. These files are merged on the basis of latitude and longitude values. We looked for duplicate values and found that there are around 30 duplicate values. We have dropped those duplicate values by keeping their first occurence. We have kept all the columns starting with ndvi in the feature file along with the labels in the merged file.
